                <p><strong>Good</strong> "CRAP" Site example</p>
                <a href="https://mondrianandme.com/">Mondrian and me. - visit site -</a> 
                <p>Description: Mondrian and Me is an interactive web page that allows users to explore abstract artistry through geometric shapes.

The site encourages users to have fun while procrastinating, blending entertainment with an artistic twist.</p>
            
            <h4>CRAP Analysis</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> The site uses bold primary colors (blue, red, and white) with sharp black lines, creating clear contrast that makes the geometric shapes stand out.</li>
                <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> The repeated use of geometric squares and color patterns provides a consistent, balanced visual experience, reflecting Mondrian's style.</li>
                <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> The geometric grid layout is perfectly aligned, giving the site a polished, modern aesthetic that draws attention to the interactive elements.</li>
                <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Interactive elements are grouped logically, allowing users to easily explore different parts of the canvas and engage with the art.</li>
            </ul>

                <p><strong>Bad</strong> "CRAP" Site example</p>
                <a href="https://www.pacificnorthwestxray.com/">Pacific Northwest X-Ray Inc. - visit site -</a>
                <p>Description: Pacific Northwest X-Ray is one of the lowest-quality websites we stumbled across. You donâ€™t really know what the website/business is all about, and there is no reason to want to learn more about it. The page is as old-school as possible, making you want to leave it as quickly as possible without bothering to type in your search query or click any links.</p>
                
                <h4>CRAP Analysis</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> The site lacks sufficient contrast, making text difficult to read against the background, resulting in a poor visual experience.</li>
                    <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> There is minimal use of consistent styles, which creates a disjointed appearance and fails to establish a cohesive brand identity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Elements on the page appear misaligned and chaotic, lacking a clear structure that guides the user's eye.</li>
                    <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Related content is not grouped logically, making it challenging for users to navigate the information effectively.</li>
