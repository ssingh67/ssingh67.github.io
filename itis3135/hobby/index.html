            <p>"Iron Paradise" is a slogan Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson uses to describe the gym with his brand in Under Armour and that's what I token the gym to be for me as well. Therefore my webspace is a showcase of that.</p>

            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>The gym has been a cornerstone of life, providing me with strength through strength training, discipline, and health.</p>
            <p>I started the gym when I was late freshman in college. I took up weightlifting as my core focus and have bee on that path ever since.</p>

            <h2>Best Times</h2>
            <p>The best times to go are usually around early morning or afternoon post lunch , I prefer going in the afternoon post lunch as I feel pumped up and can get the most out of my lifting sessions.</p>
            <h3>Great Times In General:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Early Morning:</strong> Start the day of with a good sweat.</li>
                <li><strong>Evening:</strong> Beneficial if under a tight schedule.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>As long as the gym is incorprated into the schedule it doesn't really matter when you go you'll have a proper healthy lifestyle. As long as you stick to it.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Start with simple exercises and light weights.</li>
                <li>Let the enorphins take over.</li>
                <li>Focus on form over lifting heavy.</li>
                <li>Stick to a routine that best suits you, and gradually increase difficulty in that routine.</li>
                <li><strong>HAVE NO QUIT!!!</strong></li>

            <p>There is an empowering feeling that comes out of every day in the gym, because even if I had the worse of them days that day I know I did something positive that day just by working out.</p>
